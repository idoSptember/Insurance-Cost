# Insurance-Cost
MGT 665 Comprehensive Exam Question 16

Summary: I chose to use a linear regression based on the insurance cost dataset from Kaggle which is found cited below. This dataset uses age, gender, where they live, body mass index, family, and if they're a smoker as the indicators to try to predict the patient's insurance cost.

Steps Taken:
  Using one hot encoding to preprocess the data. Based on the data set above, there wasn't much if any cleaning to be done to have it ready for a regression model and MSE or Mean Squared Error.
  Once the preprocessing has been done, I fed the data through LinearRegression off sklearn.
  Finally, the data was measured through MSE
